## Setup

### Summary of Steps to Complete (See corresponding sections below.)
- [ ] Download and install Git.
- [ ] Set up a GitHub account.
- [ ] Download and install VSCode.

### Git/Git-bash
* Download and install.
* Mac - https://git-scm.com/downloads
* Windows - https://gitforwindows.org/

### GitHub
* Set up an account.
* Link - https://www.github.com
* Configure the username and email for GitHub to work with Git.
  * In a terminal run the code `git config --global user.email "email@example.com"`
  * Don't use quotation marks, just put your desired email in and make sure it's associated with your github account (Github > Profile > Settings > Email > Add Email)
  * Then check to see if it worked by running `git config --global user.email`
  * Also set the user name by running `git config --global user.name "GitHubUserName"`
  * Your GitHub user name can also be seen at the top of the GitHub Settings page.
  * (Instructions came from answer on StackOverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56970149/how-do-i-change-the-user-in-vscode-and-link-my-github-account)
  
### VSCode
* Download and install.
* Link - https://code.visualstudio.com/download
* Macs - Students using Macs will need to move the application from their downloads folder to their applications folder. They will then need to install the code command. This is done by opening VSCode and typing command + shift + p to open the search bar. Type shell command and select the first option.
* Windows - Students using windows should change the default terminal in VSCode shell by typing ctrl + shift + p to open the search bar. Once the search bar is opened, have the students type select default shell. They will be able to select Bash as an option.

### Repl.it (optional)
A note about repl.it: I liked this site initially because it allows you to run code (Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript) online without installing anything on your computer. However, I have had performance problems with it in the past. I personally found I hardly ever used it. I'll leave it here in case people want to check it out, but don't worry about setting up an account if you don't want to. I'll list some other options for running code on line as well.

### Links to Original material (You do not need to review this material.)
I got the idea to create assignments on GitHub from some materials for the DevMountain coding bootcamp posted online. They have some interesting web development material posted on their GitHub. I'll leave the link here in case anyone is interested in looking at their information. There's no requirement to do so.
